scan_model_dirs.py script creation:

I want to create a python script to follow these guidelines:

- read env var 'MODEL_DIR' and create list of all files with gguf extension in this path. call the files list 'model_paths'

- iterate over 'model_paths', take the file name from the path, change .gguf extension to .gguf.yml and save new name in 'model_yml_paths' var. Also create those files in '/model-config' dir. The file contents is just 2 key/value pairs: 'file' and 'llama-server'. the 'file' key has the full path to .gguf file as value. 'llama-server' is a list with single key:value '--seed': -1. if the file already exists, don't overwrite it. print information to console about each created or not created file

Do not describe how the script works. Just write the code.
