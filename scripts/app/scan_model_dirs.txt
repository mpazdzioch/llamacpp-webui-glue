scan_model_dirs.py script creation:

I want to create a python script to follow these guidelines:

- create a function 'scan_path_for_models' that takes 2 arguments: path and file extension (without dot). the function returns a list of all files in this path with this extension. full paths for each file

- read env var 'MODEL_DIRS'. it contains one or more paths separated by semicolon

- traverse all paths from MODEL_DIRS together with subdirs and create single list of all files with gguf extension in those using 'scan_path_for_models' function. call the files list 'model_paths'

- iterate over 'model_paths', take the file name from the path, add .gguf.yml extension to it and save new name in 'model_yml_paths' var. Also create those files in '/model-config' dir. The file contents is just 2 key/value pairs: 'file' and 'llama-server'. the 'file' key has the full path to .gguf file as value. 'llama-server' is a list with single key:value '--seed': -1. if the file already exists, don't overwrite it. print information to console about each created or not created file

- create '/model-config/default-set.yml' file. It contains multiple entries based on 'model_yml_paths'. For each item in 'model_yml_paths' list create 'file' key with value from 'model_yml_paths' and 'active' key set to 0 for all entries except the first one where it's set to 1

- copy '/app/default-config.yml' file to '/model-config' dir

Do not describe how the script works. Just write the code.
